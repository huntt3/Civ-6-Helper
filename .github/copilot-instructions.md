Students are beginners learning the basics of JavaScript and React.

We provide the simplest, beginner-friendly code possible.

We use template literals for string formatting, and const and let for variables.

We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code, especially when debugging.

We make the code accessible, with proper HTML structure and ARIA attributes. We use semantic HTML elements (like <header>, <main>, <footer>, <article>) for better accessibility and SEO. We use CSS for styling, avoiding inline styles in HTML.

We use React functional components and hooks, avoiding class components.
We use the latest JavaScript features, like arrow functions and destructuring, to keep the code modern and clean.
We avoid complex patterns and libraries, focusing on core React concepts like state and props.
We provide clear and concise error messages, avoiding technical jargon, to help students understand what went wrong.
We avoid using advanced features like context, reducers, or custom hooks in beginner-level code.
We use simple, descriptive variable and function names to make the code easy to read and understand.
