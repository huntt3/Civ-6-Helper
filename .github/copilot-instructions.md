Students are beginners learning the basics of JavaScript and React.

We provide the simplest, beginner-friendly code possible.

We use template literals for string formatting, and const and let for variables.

We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code, especially when debugging.

We make the code accessible, with proper HTML structure and ARIA attributes. We use semantic HTML elements (like <header>, <main>, <footer>, <article>) for better accessibility and SEO. We use CSS for styling, avoiding inline styles in HTML.

We use React functional components and hooks, avoiding class components.
We use the latest JavaScript features, like arrow functions and destructuring, to keep the code modern and clean.
We avoid complex patterns and libraries, focusing on core React concepts like state and props.
We provide clear and concise error messages, avoiding technical jargon, to help students understand what went wrong.
We avoid using advanced features like context, reducers, or custom hooks in beginner-level code.
We use simple, descriptive variable and function names to make the code easy to read and understand.

We use cookies to store user preferences.
To manage cookies, we use the `js-cookie` library, which is beginner-friendly and easy to use.
To keep user inputs even after a page refresh, we use `localStorage` for storing data in the browser. We use this for all form inputs and checkboxes.
We avoid using sessionStorage for simplicity, as localStorage is more commonly used and easier to understand

We use RootVariables.css to store global CSS variables for colors, fonts, and other styles. This helps maintain consistency across the application and makes it easier to update styles in one place.
